----
## Preaching Python
Python is a high-level programming language that has rapidly become on of the most popular coding languages in the world.

 * First released in 1991 by Dutch computer mastermind Guido van Rossum
 * Most Google-serached programming language in 2018
 * Third ranked language in terms of popularity
 * Many resources, extensive documentation, and user write-ups

 This document is meant as an overview of the basic tools and knowledge that scientists should have to properly make use of Python.

----
## Why Python?
Python is

 * Free to use
 * Broad in functionality
 * Strongly rooted in clean syntax.
 * Very readable
 * Promotes clean coding practices.

----
So what can you do with python? Pretty much anything you want.

 * Software packages
 * Data analysis
 * Web development
 * Software testing
 * Compile presentations

And of course,

 * Scripting

## Resources

Given Python's popularity, there are many available resources. Most problems can be answered with a quick google search. Some good resources to start are  

 * [Python's documentation](#https://docs.python.org/3/)
 * [StackOverflow](#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
 * [Learn Python in 10 Minutes](#https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/)

## Basics

Python, like all programming languages, have different data types so that your
system knows what type of data it is looking at. The common types are

 * **int**
 * **float**
 * **string**
 * **list**
 * **dictionary**

One thing that is different than many other forms of programming is that the data type is implicit to the definition of the variable. For instance. Python knows that

 * ```a = 5``` is an integer
 * ```b = 27.654``` is a float
 * ```c = ['some', 'words', 'here', 6]``` is a list


----
### Strings
