# Python for Scientists



----
## Preaching Python
Python is a high-level programming language that has rapidly become on of the most popular coding languages in the world.

 * First released in 1991 by Dutch computer mastermind Guido van Rossum
 * Most Google-serached programming language in 2018
 * Third ranked language in terms of popularity
 * Many resources, extensive documentation, and user write-ups

 This document is meant as an overview of the basic tools and knowledge that scientists should have to properly make use of Python.

----
## Why Python?
Python is

 * Free to use
 * Broad in functionality
 * Strongly rooted in clean syntax
 * Promotes clean coding practices

##So what can you do with python?

Pretty much anything you want

 * Software packages
 * Data analysis
 * Web development
 * Software testing
 * Compile presentations

And of course,

 * Scripting

## Resources

Given Python's popularity, there are many available resources. Most problems can be answered with a quick google search. Some good resources to start are  

 * [Python's documentation](#https://docs.python.org/3/)
 * [StackOverflow](#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
 * [Learn Python in 10 Minutes](#https://www.stavros.io/tutorials/python/)

## Basics

Python, like all programming languages, have different data types so that your
system knows what type of data it is looking at. The common types are

 * **int**
 * **float**
 * **string**
 * **list**
 * **dictionary**

One thing that is different than many other forms of programming is that the data type is implicit to the definition of the variable. For instance. Python knows that

 * ```a = 5``` is an integer
 * ```b = 27.654``` is a float
 * ```c = ['some', 'words', 'here', 6]``` is a list


----
### Strings

A string is a python datatype that stores any combination of characters and recognizes them as text. Documentation on the str class can be found at

 https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str

The str class has many useful built in methods, such as *lower*, *upper*, and *replace*

----
### Lists

In Python, a list allows you to store any other datatype in an ordered fashion. Common list methods can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html.

In this example, we put some integers and strings in a list, and then modify the list.

----
### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are a data structure that allow you to store an unordered combination of keys and values. A key is sort of like an index that tells you where to find a piece of data (your value).

----
### Arrays (np)

----
### Pandas DataFrames

----
### Loops

----
### Conditionals

----
## Important Packages
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
netCDF4

----
## Importing APIs and Docs
reading docs on apis
importing apis
using apis

----
## Object Oriented Programming
what is a class?
attributes
methods
inheritance
----
## Higher level stuff
List comprehension

----
## Examples
Copy and read csv
 - plot, modify time series data

Copy and read NetCDF
 - plot, mask, etc
