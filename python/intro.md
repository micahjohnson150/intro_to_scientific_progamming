# Python for Scientists
Python is a high-level programming language that has rapidly become on of the most popular coding languages in the world. The language was first released to the world in 1991 by Dutch computer mastermind Guido van Rossum, and has steadily grown in use since then. In 2018, Python became the most Google-searched programming language, and is ranked 3rd for overall popularity. This means there are many resources, such as extensive documentation and user write-ups, for new and experienced programmers to utilize.

Python is free to use, broad in functionality, and is strongly rooted in clean syntax. This last point means that it is very readable and promotes clean coding practices. This document is meant as an overview of the basic related tools and knowledge that scientists should have to properly make use of Python.
